jQuery.wpfiles
==============

This is a simple jQuery plugin designed to give developers using wordpress a simple and non destructive way to utilize the wordpress file manage/upload interface.

Example Use:
------------

the following example simply attaches the functionality available in the wp_editor to any element when it's clicked. The anonymous function passed into the plugin will be called upon selection of a file. By default it will look for an input field with a name equal to the rel attribute of the button.

<script>
  jQuery(window).ready(function($){
    $('.wpfile').wpfiles(function(filename){
      console.log(this);
      console.log(filename);
    });
  });
</script>

<input type="text" name="images[0]" value="" />
<button class="wpfile" rel="images[0]"> Choose File </button>

Important Note:
---------------

Were you using a proper CMS to build whatever you're building you wouldn't even need this. Use PyroCMS if you're sick of googling solutions for this kind of dumb crap.
